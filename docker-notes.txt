Please install docker first and have it running in linux mode (if installed on windows), this should be the default.
Using powershell from this directory, run:

docker-compose up --build

or after you have done the above you can start in background with:

docker-compose start

then to stop:

docker-compose stop

to connect to a container that is running, use:
docker ps -a
to determine which container to connect to

then:
docker exec -i -t [container name] /bin/bash
to connect, if where epwebcatfinjsdemo_server_1 is the container name:
docker exec -i -t epwebcatfinjsdemo_server_1 /bin/bash
you will now be in a bash shell on the running docker container.

--notes on docker builds if you don't want to use compose

cd web
docker build -t eikos/fsweb .
